<p class="fourthP">DanceAfrica is BAM's longest running program and America's largest celebration of African and African-American dance, music, and culture. Created in 1977, under the artistic direction of Founding Elder Chuck Davis and with the aim of heightening awareness of African culture, the festival has evolved into a beloved annual Memorial Day weekend event that brings the entire community together. In 2015, the leadership baton was passed to Abdel R. Salaam.
</p>

<p class="fifthP">Each year DanceAfrica welcomes a new visiting company from Africa or its diaspora at the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. The performances include other traditional and contemporary dance companies, including the students of BAM/Restoration DanceAfrica Ensemble, and live music.
